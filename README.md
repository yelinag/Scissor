**Introduction**

Scissors is a food package review application, built as an Android application, 
that acts as a convenient mediator between food manufacturers who want to collect feedback 
about their packaging and consumers who want to provide this feedback. 
The incentive for consumers to use this application is to view the ratings and reviews of other food packages as well.

**Objectives**

 * Collect user experience data to improve design and safety
 * Assess the difficulty of opening various packages
 * Plan, collect, compare and share food package opening information
